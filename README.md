# odin-recipes

During my initial task in the updated Odin Project curriculum, I learned the ropes of completing HTML templates, organizing directories and files, and maneuvering through the terminal. I gained proficiency in adding headers, paragraphs, images, and links to my project. I also became adept at crafting both ordered and unordered lists for my recipes. Crucially, I structured my code to be user-friendly, ensuring it's accessible and easy to comprehend for all readers.
